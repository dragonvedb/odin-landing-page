# odin-landing-page

11 of October 2022:

Creating this landing page is part of The Odin Project curriculum. And thank GOD this time around I don't have to come up with the design myself.

Even though this is the final project of the HTML and CSS introductional sections, I don't expect it to be especially challenging. The design seems relatively straightforward to implement, and thanks to freeCodeCamp I already have experience working with flexbox. Yet I expect this project to be a good way to practice creating a webpage according to client's specifications.
