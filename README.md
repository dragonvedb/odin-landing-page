# odin-landing-page

11 of October 2022:

Creating this landing page is part of The Odin Project curriculum. And thank GOD this time around I don't have to come up with the design myself.

Even though this is the final project of the HTML and CSS introductional sections, I don't expect it to be especially challenging. The design seems relatively straightforward to implement, and thanks to freeCodeCamp I already have experience working with flexbox. Yet I expect this project to be a good way to practice creating a webpage according to client's specifications.

The page is finished! It was basically done yesterday, but today I added icons and actual text. I could experiment with colors and fonts and layouts, but honestly, I don't want to spend more time on this, since trying to design my own website is a reliable way to paralyse me for days.

The page looks good. I had fun. Especially enjoyed coming up with texts parodying corporate landing page cliches.
